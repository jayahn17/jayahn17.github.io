## CAPTAIN: Smart Steering Through Waves for Sustainable Marine Transportation

**Team Members:** Evan Koo, Seongjae Ahn, Arsh Khan, Prof. Reza Alim

### Project Overview

As an Undergraduate Research Assistant at the Theoretical & Applied Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (TAF Lab) at UC Berkeley, I worked on developing an autonomous ocean drone prototype for sustainable marine transportation. This project was part of the U.S. Department of Energy's "Power at the Sea Prize" competition, where we ranked in the Top 20.

### Key Achievements

- **Licensed IP** for "PowerCab: A Multimodal Mobile Sea-based Power Generation and Delivery"
- **Pitched to Vice Chancellor in Research at UC Berkeley** alongside 3 co-workers, presenting our innovative autonomous ocean drone solution
- Led electronics implementation with 7+ sensors and established wireless communication using the Xbee protocol
- Developed autonomous up/downwind control using wind vanes, GPS, magnetometer, and motors
- Conducted over 50 ocean tests and built a real-time raw data acquisition pipeline linking device firmware to a Python database
