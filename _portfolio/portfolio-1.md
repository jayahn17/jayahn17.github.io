## CAPTAIN: Smart Steering Through Waves For A Sustainable Marine Transportation

**Team Members:** Evan Kuo, Seongjae Ahn, Arsh Khan, Prof. Reza Alam

### Project Overview
As an Undergraduate Research Assistant at the Theoretical & Applied Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (TAF Lab) at UC Berkeley, I led electronics integration and autonomy development for an autonomous ocean drone prototype focused on sustainable marine transportation. The project placed in the Top 20 of the U.S. Department of Energy "Power at the Sea Prize."

### Key Achievements

- **Submitted licensed IP** for "PowerCab: A Multimodal Mobile Sea-based Power Generation and Delivery"
- Led electronics implementation with 7+ sensors and established wireless communication using the XBee protocol
- Developed autonomous up/downwind control system using windvanes, GPS, magnetometer, and servo/stepper motors
- Conducted 50+ ocean tests and built a real-time raw data acquisition pipeline linking device firmware to a Python database
- **Pitched to the Vice Chancellor for Research (VCR) at UC Berkeley** with our team, presenting our autonomous ocean drone solution for data collection.

### Responsibilities

**Electronics Integration & Sensor Systems:**
- Integrated 7+ sensors including GPS, magnetometer, windvanes, and IMU sensors for autonomous navigation
- Established wireless communication network using XBee protocol for real-time data transmission between drone and base station
- Designed and implemented sensor fusion algorithms to combine data from multiple sensors for accurate positioning and orientation

**Autonomous Control System:**
- Developed an up/downwind control system that enables the drone to autonomously navigate based on wind conditions
- Implemented control algorithms using windvane data, GPS coordinates, and magnetometer readings
- Programmed motor control systems for precise maneuvering and station-keeping in ocean environments

**Data Pipeline & Testing:**
- Built real-time raw data acquisition pipeline connecting device firmware to Python-based database system
- Conducted 50+ ocean tests to validate system performance and reliability
- Analyzed sensor data to optimize control parameters and improve autonomous navigation accuracy
