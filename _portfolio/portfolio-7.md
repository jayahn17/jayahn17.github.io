## ME102B - Mechatronics: Robotic Fish

### Project Overview

This project was completed as part of ME102B (Mechatronics) coursework at UC Berkeley. Designed a unique tail mechanism for a robotic fish, earning second place at the design showcase. The project integrated mechanical design, electronics, and control systems to create a biomimetic swimming robot.

### My Contributions

**Tail Mechanism Design:**
- Designed and implemented a unique multi-segment tail mechanism inspired by fish locomotion
- Developed kinematic model for tail motion to generate efficient swimming patterns
- Optimized tail geometry and joint configuration for maximum thrust generation
- Prototyped and tested various tail designs to achieve natural swimming motion

**Mechanical System:**
- Designed complete robotic fish body structure with integrated tail mechanism
- Selected and integrated appropriate actuators (servo motors) for tail control
- Optimized weight distribution and buoyancy for stable swimming performance
- Created waterproof housing for electronics and actuators

**Electronics & Control:**
- Designed and implemented control circuits for motor control and sensor integration
- Developed control algorithms to generate sinusoidal and wave-like tail motions
- Integrated sensors for feedback control and swimming behavior adjustment
- Programmed microcontroller to execute swimming patterns and control sequences

**System Integration:**
- Integrated mechanical, electrical, and software components into cohesive system
- Tested and refined control parameters for optimal swimming performance
- Validated system performance through pool testing and iterative improvements

### Key Achievements

- Designed and implemented a unique tail mechanism for robotic fish locomotion
- Earned second place at the design showcase
- Integrated mechatronic systems including actuators, sensors, and control systems
- Successfully demonstrated biomimetic swimming motion
