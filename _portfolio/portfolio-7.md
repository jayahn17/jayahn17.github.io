## AutomaticSnow Goggles - Bioinspired by Nictitating Membrane

### Project Overview

AutomaticSnow Goggles is a product development project from ME110 (Undergraduate Project 4) that features an innovative bioinspired design based on the nictitating membrane found in bird eyes. The goggles incorporate an automatic lens cleaning mechanism that mimics the protective and cleaning function of a bird's third eyelid.

### Bioinspired Design

The design is inspired by the nictitating membrane, a translucent third eyelid found in birds that sweeps across the eye horizontally to protect and clean the eye surface. This biological mechanism provides continuous eye protection without obstructing vision, making it an ideal inspiration for snow goggles that need to maintain clear vision in harsh winter conditions.
