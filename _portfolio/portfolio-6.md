## MSC - 3D Reconstruction

### Project Overview

Implemented a comprehensive 3D reconstruction pipeline using Worldlab.ai, Nvidia 3Dgrut, and Isaac Lab to create 3D assets from render-to-sim-to-asset workflow. This project focuses on generating high-quality 3D assets that can be used in simulation environments and real-world applications.

### Key Technologies

**Worldlab.ai Integration:**
- Integrated Worldlab.ai platform for 3D asset generation and processing
- Utilized advanced rendering capabilities for high-fidelity asset creation

**Nvidia 3Dgrut:**
- Implemented Nvidia 3Dgrut for 3D reconstruction and geometry processing
- Leveraged GPU-accelerated reconstruction algorithms for efficient asset generation

**Isaac Lab:**
- Deployed assets in Nvidia Isaac Lab simulation environment
- Validated asset quality and performance in physics-based simulations

**Render-to-Sim-to-Asset Pipeline:**
- Developed end-to-end pipeline from rendered images to simulation-ready 3D assets
- Automated the conversion process from visual representations to usable 3D models

### Technical Implementation

- Set up integration between Worldlab.ai, Nvidia 3Dgrut, and Isaac Lab
- Implemented data pipeline for converting rendered images to 3D geometry
