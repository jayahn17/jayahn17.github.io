## MSC - 3D Reconstruction

### Project Overview

Implemented a comprehensive 3D reconstruction pipeline using Worldlab.ai, NVIDIA 3Dgrut, and Isaac Lab to create 3D assets from a render-to-sim-to-asset workflow. This project focuses on generating high-quality 3D assets that can be used in simulation environments and real-world applications.
