## ME239 - Robotic Locomotion

### Project Overview

This project was completed as part of ME239 (Robotic Locomotion) coursework at UC Berkeley. 

This Robotic Locomotion Control Algorithm has been developed based on an open source spider robot CAD hardware model from [ZaidHJaber's repository](https://github.com/ZaidHJaber/Four-legged-Spider-Robot-RL-locomotion). Huge thanks to ZaidHJaber for providing the foundation model for the spider robot!

### Key Features

- Analysis on Jacobian in 4 legged robot locomotions
- Check feasibility of the unit from the open source CAD and framework, and developed 'forward jump' controls
