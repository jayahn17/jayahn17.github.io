## CalSol - Solar Vehicle Team

### Project Overview

Working with CalSol, UC Berkeley's solar vehicle team, on battery and suspension systems for competitive solar-powered vehicles. CalSol competes in the American Solar Challenge, building high-performance solar vehicles that demonstrate sustainable transportation technology.

### My Contributions

**Battery System Development:**
- Designed and implemented advanced battery management system (BMS) for optimal power distribution
- Developed monitoring and safety systems to protect battery cells during charging and discharging cycles
- Optimized battery pack configuration for maximum energy density while maintaining safety margins
- Worked on power distribution network to efficiently route energy from solar panels to motor systems

**Suspension System Design:**
- Analyzed and optimized suspension geometry for solar vehicle performance requirements
- Designed suspension components to balance handling, stability, and weight constraints
- Performed finite element analysis (FEA) on suspension components to ensure structural integrity
- Prototyped and tested suspension systems to validate design performance

**Integration & Testing:**
- Integrated battery and suspension systems with overall vehicle architecture
- Conducted performance testing and optimization of both systems
- Collaborated with electrical and mechanical teams to ensure seamless system integration
