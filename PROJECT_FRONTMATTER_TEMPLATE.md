- Add `tech_tags` as an array of short strings for filtering and display.
- Use `featured: true` for projects you want showcased on the homepage.
- Keep `excerpt` concise (one sentence) and move details into the body.
- Populate `impact` with measurable outcomes when possible.

Example usage:
Place this front-matter at the top of a portfolio file (`_portfolio/*.md`) and update the fields accordingly.
